Organic doesn't mean that optimal soil practices were used,like cover crop / no till,which leave the soil and its biological life minimally disturbed and require minimal fertilizer/pesticide use because the the soil is kept covered,and plants are left to decompose slowly on the surface which fertilizes.|organic-environment|n,,

All the factors favoring sustainability on the long run,support organic farming as the future of agriculture around the globe.|organic-general|p,,,,
Let me quote from my previous answer Deekshith Pinto's answer to Can India afford organic farming?|organic-general|p,,,,,
Let us see them one by one:There is no questions about the environmental sustainability of organic farming.|organic-environment|n,,,,,
The chemical fertilizers and pesticides have cascading impacts on the ecological resilience of any region by killing many essential creatures apart from impacts on the human health,poisoning water and land,degrading the fertility,and so on.|conventional-safety and healthiness|n,,
Even during production these chemicals possess a huge carbon and water footprint,disrupts nitrogen and phosphate cycles,and pollutes local environment.|conventional-safety and healthiness|n,,,
The organic farming techniques have proven to be of far less harm to the environment and human health.|organic-environment|p,,,,,
With current state of technology,yes,organic farming is comparatively costlier and gives less output.|organic-price|n,,,
Mind you,even these stats vary quite considerably depending on the scale,region,farming practices,etc.,and sometimes it has been even demonstrated that organic farming can also be more profitable than inorganic.|organic-general|0
However,given the current policy regime of subsidized chemical fertilizers and pesticides and the lack of awareness towards the nuanced techniques of organic farming,it does become less profitable.|organic-general|0,,,
However,what most of the land users (farmers) fail to recognize is the masking effect of the chemical fertilizers and pesticides on the continued degradation of their own land leading them towards a vicious circle where these chemicals degrades land productivity and the farmers apply even more chemicals to increase productivity.|organic-safety and healthiness|n,,,,
At one point the economic viability of inorganic farming also diminishes as the land degrades more and more.|conventional-general|n,,,,,
Therefore,it is always beneficial for the farmers to turn to organic farming in the long run,though it might mean less profits in the present circumstance.|organic-general|n,,,
The small land holders who live on a season to season basis might find it difficult due to the economy of scales but the medium and large scale farmers must shift to organic farming for their ow interest as well as for the benefit of the society.|organic-general|0,,,,,
The difference is though that “better for the environment” is far less BS than “it’s healthier” – because in its actual sense “organic” does mean “better for the environment” while it doesn’t mean “healthier” in its actual sense.|organic-environment|p,,,,,
It did mean “healthier” around 20 years ago,at least in Europe.|organic-safety and healthiness|0,,,,
But the pesticides that were used for “non-organic” food are now banned,so that difference is gone.|conventional-safety and healthiness|0,,,,
"""Organic"" farming and ""regular"" farming are also difficult to define.|organic-general|0",,,,,
But to provide my (biased) opinion,the answer is no.|organic-general|n,,,,
My basic reason is that regular farming can incorporate all the techniques that organic farming employs,plus more .|conventional-general|p,,,,
Organic farming,by the certification definition,is restricted to the use of certain techniques.|organic-general|0,,,

This is a good question and depends on the US definition of Organic wine.|organic-trustworthy sources|0,,,,,
There are two types in the US.|organic-trustworthy sources|0,,,,,
Wine Made With Organic Grapes and 100% Organic wine(USDA Organic).|organic-trustworthy sources|0,,,,,
The first category is (As it's wording states) made from organic certified grapes but not made with organic principles in the cellar.|organic-trustworthy sources|0,,,,,
The main point of differentiation to consumers is that sulphur dioxide is allowed to be added,with a maximum of 100 Parts per Million.|organic-trustworthy sources|0,,,,
Though i have to point out that there is no control of this limit at all with either the US government or producing country,in the case of imported wines.|organic-trustworthy sources|0,,,,
So these wines can fluctuate easily well above 100 ppm.|organic-trustworthy sources|0,,,,,
The total Sulfite level in the finished wine has to be under 10 Parts per Million and no other Non Organic ingredients are allowed.|organic-trustworthy sources|0,,,,,
This category of wine has to under go USDA Lab analysis every vintage to prove it is what it claims.|organic-trustworthy sources|0,,,,,
Of course like all marketeers we think the best Organic wines are the ones we import and distribute through out the US.|organic-trustworthy sources|p,,,,,
