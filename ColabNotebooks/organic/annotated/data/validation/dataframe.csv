David-Riefenstahl|David Riefenstahl|1920|2|0|nan|nan|nan|First off, one has to point out that there isn't actually too little food being produced globally (at least right now), it's just that it's in the wrong places, a lot is being wasted, and yet more is in relatively inefficient forms (like meat).|quora.json|abilasha|nan-nan
David-Riefenstahl|David Riefenstahl|1920|3|0|nan|nan|nan|Most starving people actually being in Africa as of today and the most significant increase in population driving the demand for more calories being there as well, the first objective for Africa will be to feed itself.|quora.json|abilasha|nan-nan

David-Riefenstahl|David Riefenstahl|1920|6|0|nan|nan|nan|Take as an example this study by the Ghanaian ministry of agriculture that tallies the average crop yields across the country under rainfed conditions: Notice that for the majority of the crops, production per hectare could be doubled, tripled, even quadrupled, and that is not taking into account any heavy technical input (six tonnes of maize per hectare is just over the global yield average, but the most advanced countries like the US, France or Italy average 9 or 10, and the recordholder in Iowa apparently reached yields of over 20).|quora.json|abilasha|nan-nan
