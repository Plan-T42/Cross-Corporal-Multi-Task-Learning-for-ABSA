But these certified organic eggs that are 97% likely to be not meaningfully different than other eggs, need to look like real organic eggs.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']

Organic labeling in the US is regulated by the Department of Agriculture, which offers a ton of materials explaining what the labels mean.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
A good start is this blog post: Organic 101: What the USDA Organic Label Means .|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
The main points explaining what Organic and Made with Organic Products are: Produce can be called organic if it’s certified to have grown on soil that had no prohibited substances applied for three years prior to harvest.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Prohibited substances include most synthetic fertilizers and pesticides.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
In instances when a grower has to use a synthetic substance to achieve a specific purpose, the substance must first be approved according to criteria that examine its effects on human health and the environment (see other considerations in “Organic 101: Allowed and Prohibited Substances”).As for organic meat, regulations require that animals are raised in living conditions accommodating their natural behaviors (like the ability to graze on pasture), fed 100% organic feed and forage, and not administered antibiotics or hormones.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
When it comes to processed, multi-ingredient foods, the USDA organic standards specify additional considerations.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Regulations prohibit organically processed foods from containing artificial preservatives, colors, or flavors and require that their ingredients are organic, with some minor exceptions.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
For example, processed organic foods may contain some approved non-agricultural ingredients, like enzymes in yogurt, pectin in fruit jams, or baking soda in baked goods.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
When packaged products indicate they are “made with organic [specific ingredient or food group],” this means they contain at least 70% organically produced ingredients.|['organic-general']|['0']
The remaining non-organic ingredients are produced without using prohibited practices (genetic engineering, for example) but can include substances that would not otherwise be allowed in 100% organic products.|['organic-general']|['0']
“Made with organic” products will not bear the USDA organic seal, but, as with all other organic products, must still identify the USDA-accredited certifier.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
You can look for the identity of the certifier on a packaged product for verification that the organic product meets USDA’s organic standards.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
As with all organic foods, none of it is grown or handled using genetically modified organisms, which the organic standards expressly prohibit (see “Organic 101: What Organic Farming (and Processing) Doesn’t Allow”).|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']

Economically, this is beneficial to the farmer, but when crops grow too fast, the antioxidants that are supposed to develop don’t get the chance, and instead, starches and sugars take their place and when sugar (glucose) binds to your body’s proteins, it produces advanced non-enzymatic glycosylation end products, which are “sugar-coated” proteins that have become stiff and dysfunctional, leading to massive amounts of the tissue damage that underlies chronic disease and aging.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']

I eat organic food because the philosophy of organics is important to me.|['organic-general']|['p']

Organic food as I mean it might be better referred to as biologically grown.|['organic-environment']|['p']
This is distinct from “industrial”-style organic (not remarkably different than industrial conventional), and is more akin to how the concept was originally intended (before being co-opted by big agribusiness money).|['organic-environment']|['0']
Biologically grown refers to crops grown in a more nature-friendly model of agriculture.|['organic-environment']|['p']
The emphasis is on creating healthy and fertile soil, from which healthy, vigorous plants (with strong immune systems of their own to protect them against pests and diseases) naturally arise.|['organic-environment']|['p']
The distinction might be compared to that of raising a child on a healthy and varied diet versus raising a child on a diet of coffee, sugar, and maybe cocaine (which is more comparable to the industrial model of conve tonal agriculture.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
The point I’m driving at is that organics is about health, definitely.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
I am much more interested in eating plants that are naturally strong and vigorous and thus don’t need to be sprayed against pests or diseases at all, whether conventional or organically approved sprays.|['organic-general']|['p']
