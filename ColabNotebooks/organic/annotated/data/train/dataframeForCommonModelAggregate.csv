Until the 20th century, all farming was organic, and the record of famine, erosion, plant disease, and permanently degraded soils is irrefutable.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Modern organic farmers in rich countries farm in a very responsible manner.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['p']
It’s another story in poor countries.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
Of course, in poor countries, the environmental record of using modern techniques is pretty lousy too.|['organic-environment']|['n']
GM plants can certainly be grown without pesticides or herbicides, and using only “natural” (the term is a joke) fertilizers.|['GMO-environment']|['p']
But the high priests of the organic movement somehow think seed varieties male a difference too, even though almost none of the crop seeds in use today would have occurred naturally.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
It is certainty true that farming without pesticides and herbicides will not present the risk of those chemicals getting into people, soils, air, or water.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-environment']|['p', 'p', 'p']
However, because of reduced yields, the same amount of land, water, fuel, and labor is used to produce less food.|['organic-environment']|['n']
I think this is wasteful.|['organic-environment']|['n']
Yes, the use of GMO crops produces a significant improvement for the environment, as well as increased yield of nutritionally-denser foods grown where they could not be grown before: AgBioForum 8(2&3): GM Crops: The Global Economic and Environmental Impact Altered pesticide use on transgenic crops and the associated general impact from an environmental perspective Yield Effects of Genetically Modified Crops in Developing Countries However, the other aspects of organic farming also seem to have a positive impact on the environment: Environmental Impact of Different Agricultural Management Practices: Conventional vs. Organic Agriculture although of course that doesn’t take into account the urgent need for the increased yields from non-organic farming, in terms of feeding the entire population of the world with a nutritionally-adequate diet.|['GMO-experienced quality', 'GMO-safety and healthiness', 'GMO-environment', 'GMO-environment']|['p', 'p', 'p', 'p']
And it doesn’t consider newfangled methods like vertical farming.|['organic-environment']|['n']
So I guess the answer is to use organic methods on GM crops.|['organic-environment', 'GMO-environment']|['p', 'p']
In case the question changes, the one I answered was: “Is there a significant difference in the environmental impacts of organic vs GMO agricultural practices?”|['organic-environment', 'GMO-environment']|['0', '0']
In general organic is worse for the environment and GMO better.|['organic-environment', 'GMO-environment']|['n', 'p']
Organic methods are typically low yield, which means they have a bigger resource impact, including the amount of land required.|['organic-environment']|['n']
In the U.S., at least, they also use pesticides which are more toxic than those used in conventional farming, and in higher quantities.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'p']
Most GMO crops to date, on the other hand, have focused on increasing yields and allowing the use of fewer, less, and less toxic pesticides.|['GMO-environment', 'GMO-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'p']
You could perhaps find corner cases where the opposite is true.|['GMO-general']|['0']

There is no nutritional advantage to organic.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
It is purely a marketing term.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
And if you think that organic farming isn’t commercial, you are ignoring the fact that it is a huge industry, every bit as commercial as any other.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
There isn't really a such thing as “GMO agricultural practices”.|['GMO-general']|['n']
Also, the opposite of “organic” in the context it is typically used is “conventional”, not “GMO”.|['organic-trustworthy sources', 'conventional-trustworthy sources']|['0', '0']
GMO refers to something related but different.|['GMO-trustworthy sources']|['0']
As to your question, no, there are not significant difference in the environmental impacts of typical organic foods versus most conventional foods, or most GM foods.|['organic-trustworthy sources', 'conventional-trustworthy sources', 'GMO-trustworthy sources']|['n', 'p', 'p']
They are all often both equally destructive of soil, and all can equally end up with excess amounts of harmful chemicals accumulating in the environment (whether “organic” or not).|['organic-environment', 'conventional-environment', 'organic-environment', 'conventional-environment', 'GMO-environment']|['n', 'n', 'n', 'n', 'n']
The one significant difference I can think of, which on a wide enough scale could be rather dramatic, is the use of synthetic nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers in the production of conventional food.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
At least half or more of all fertilizer applied to fields is not used by the crops and so washes out into ground and surface water sources, compromising well water, making rivers unsafe to swim in, causing huge algal blooms, massive fish die-offs, and the Mississippi dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
With organic production, it is possible a similar effect could occur, though differing practices might limit the severity as well.|['organic-environment', 'organic-environment']|['n', 'p']

On the other hand, organic food production is not an advantage when trying to maximize crop yield from limited land.|['organic-environment']|['n']
It is less efficient.|['organic-environment']|['n']
Further, ready-to-eat plants such as lettuce, green onion, are more vulnerable to contamination by animal waste and the bacteria it contains (especially E. coli which can survive in soil).|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'n']

With some, you may be encouraged to peel the fruit as a protective measure which already means you are losing a facet of their value.|['conventional-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-experienced quality']|['n', 'n']
Mostly they taste better, have a higher vitamin content/ increased nutritional value and they haven't been force fed with superphosphate fertilisers which in the long run just tires out the soil and compromises quality.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-experienced quality', 'organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-experienced quality', 'organic-environment']|['p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p']
The soil they are grown in is richer with biodynamic material, which as a whole, not only improves the fruit quality, but is alot better on our environment aswell.|['organic-experienced quality', 'organic-environment']|['p', 'p']
Ultimately organic is healthier for both us and the planet.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-environment']|['p', 'p']

Anyhow, I think this exerpt ssys it better than I did.. For instance, while organic farmers and food producers grow and produce food without using synthetic pesticides, herbicides, hormones, antibiotics and artificial fertilisers, certain naturally occurring pesticides or herbicides such as pyrethrins, light oils, copper and sulphur and biological substances are permitted for use in organic farming.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']

If there’s no choice and I have to buy US apples and other produce, I go for organic ones.|['organic-trustworthy sources', 'organic-general']|['p', 'p']

There are good reasons for those bans: those particular pesticides are not safe for humans and also damage the environment, especially bees.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-environment']|['n', 'n']
So for safety’s sake and also for the bees’ sake, US organic apples are safer and healthier than regular US apples, even though they do cost more, while BC “inorganic” apples (if there were such a thing as an inorganic apple I would like to see it.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'p']

Organic food in the original sense of the term arose from a very real concern shared by many people for the quality and healthfulness of their food and the system of industrial agriculture that produces it.|['organic-experienced quality', 'organic-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'p']
Unfortunately, to most people it is framed in very simplistic terms: has this food been sprayed with some chemical(s) or not?|['conventional-general']|['0']
In a deeper sense of the term, the growing popularity of Organic food reflects the desire of many people to eat food that is grown responsibly and thoughtfully, that among other things might involve care for animals and their well being, care for the people that do the work, concern for what happens downstream of the farm, interest in building and maintaining dynamic and sustainable rural communities, and/or the desire to create systems of agriculture that can endure into the indefinite future (...since our current system of industrial agriculture cannot).|['organic-environment', 'organic-general', 'organic-environment']|['p', 'p', 'p']
What this gets at is that the growing of organic food is not just concerned with the health or quality of a carrot or an egg but rather in the process strives to build health in bigger ways too: that of the soil, of the farmer, of farm animals, of wild animals, of the farmer's community, of the consumer that he relies on, of biodiversity in general (for the earth's own sake, if not the various ecological services it provides, such as pollinators and other sorts of beneficial insects), of all people.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-environment']|['p', 'p']

In the US, organic farming can use pesticides, so long as they are natural.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
Regular farming as you call it, is not sustainable for the following reasons: 1) Monocropping leads to depletion of nutrients from the soil leading to lesser yields and bad crop health.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
2) Cost of Fertilizers, Pesticides is high and dependant directly on the international crude oil market.|['conventional-price']|['n']
Just a look at the price of Urea/DAP, Potash etc over the last 15 years will give an idea on the increase in costs.|['conventional-price']|['n']
3) Usage of chemicals heats up the soil, kills microbes ( which actually do the work of producing food for the plants).|['conventional-environment']|['n']
Water usage goes up and dependancy on irrigation borewells, dams etc is created.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
4) The produce is not valued by the markets and in most cases the supply will be higher than the demand and price will be low.|['conventional-general', 'conventional-price']|['n', '0']
Organic/Natural Farming is sustainable provided some patience and efforts are taken to understand our soil, climate, plants and how the ecosystem works.|['organic-general']|['p']

The variations between organic and traditional foods stem directly from the farming ways that were used throughout the food’s production.|['organic-general']|['0']
Agriculture includes a direct result on the environment, therefore understanding what goes into our agriculture is vital.|['organic-environment']|['0']
Below may be a list of a number of the key variations between organic and traditional farming.|['organic-general', 'conventional-general']|['0', '0']
Organic farming works to extend property, variety, and to encourage sensible soil and air quality.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Organic Farming Organic farming minimizes chemical usage Organic farming promotes variety Soil health is improved with organic farming practices solely natural ways square measure employed in organic farming Conventional Farming typical farming makes use of chemicals, synthetics, and different materials to manage weeds and pests typical farming uses unnatural farming ways typical farming use of pesticides has garnered attention towards acceptable levels of toxicity, and whether or not there ought to truly be a suitable level Pesticides employed in typical farming is damaging to your health.|['organic-environment', 'conventional-environment', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'n', 'n']
There square measure several different variations between organic and traditional farming, however these appear to be the foremost spoken of with regard to client health.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['0', '0']
There are arguments around whether or not or not typical farming ways square measure safe for one’s health.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
this is often owing to the pesticides and GMO’s employed in the standard farming practices.|['GMO-safety and healthiness']|['0']
many of us square measure involved that those growing practices promote unsafe chemical use, particularly as a result of the amount of toxicity is alleged to be underneath a “safe” level, however what's very safe?|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
I think it's important to note that agriculture does not have to be viewed as organic versus conventional.|['organic-general', 'conventional-general']|['0', '0']
Conventional farming uses many methods that organic farmers use and vice versa.|['conventional-general', 'organic-general']|['0', '0']
Yes organic farming is more sustainable than regular farming methods.|['organic-environment', 'conventional-environment']|['p', 'n']
Organic farming is a safer and healthier practice because it makes use of the wastes from farms and gardens to fertilize the soil, instead of using the artificial fertilizers which contain harmful chemicals, pesticides, insecticides, etc.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'p']
Organic farming methods do not involve intensive farming practices like single cropping which is practiced in regular farming.|['organic-general']|['0']
The pesticides used in organic method of farming is less toxic, is more natural containing nutrients, microbes, etc.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
This also helps in reducing wastes from farming land as all the wastes are utilized in increasing soil fertility, thus, making t environment friendly.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Kalgudi - Helping everyone across the globe with agricultural information You might think organic food would cost less than conventional food since the production is spared the cost of the chemicals, synthetic pesticides, and antibiotics.|['organic-price']|['0']
Yet organic products typically cost 20 percent to 100 percent more than their conventionally produced equivalents.|['organic-price']|['n']
Here are the top factors contributing to the high price of organic food 1.|['organic-price']|['n']
No chemicals means more labor Conventional farmers use all of those chemicals and synthetic pesticides because they end up reducing the cost of production by getting the job done faster and more efficiently.|['conventional-price']|['p']
Without them, organic farmers have to hire more workers for tasks like hand-weeding, cleanup of polluted water, and the remediation of pesticide contamination.|['organic-general']|['0']
Demand overwhelms supply Organic farmland only accounts for 0.9 percent of total worldwide farmland, and organic farms tend to produce less than conventional farms.|['organic-environment']|['n']
Conventional farms have the farmland and the supply to keep costs down since manufacturers are able to reduce costs when producing a product in larger quantities.|['conventional-price']|['p']
Higher cost of fertilizer for organic crops Sewage sludge and chemical fertilizers might not be something you want in your food, but conventional farmers use them because they don’t cost much and are cheap to transport.|['organic-price', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'n']
Organic farmers eschew these inexpensive solutions in order to keep their crops natural and instead use compost and animal manure, which is more expensive to ship.|['organic-price']|['n']
Crop rotation Instead of using chemical weed-killers, organic farmers conduct sophisticated crop rotations to keep their soil healthy and prevent weed growth.|['organic-environment']|['p']
"After harvesting a crop, an organic farmer may use that area to grow ""cover crops,"" which add nitrogen to the soil to benefit succeeding crops."|['organic-general']|['p']
Post-harvest handling cost In order to avoid cross-contamination, organic produce must be separated from conventional produce after being harvested.|['organic-general', 'conventional-general']|['0', '0']
Conventional crops are shipped in larger quantities since conventional farms are able to produce more.|['conventional-environment']|['p']
Organic crops, however, are handled and shipped in smaller quantities since organic farms tend to produce less, and this results in higher costs.|['organic-environment', 'organic-price']|['n', 'n']
Additionally, organic farms are usually located farther from major cities, increasing the shipping cost.|['organic-price']|['n']
Cost of covering higher loss Conventional farmers use certain chemicals to reduce their loss of crops.|['conventional-general']|['0']
Since organic farmers don’t use these, their losses are higher, which costs the farmer more and increases the cost to the consumer.|['organic-price']|['n']
Additionally, without all the chemical preservatives added to conventional foods, organic foods face a shorter storage time and shelf life.|['organic-environment']|['n']
Organic food grows more slowly Time is money.|['organic-environment']|['n']
Not only are organic farms typically smaller than conventional ones, but they also, on average, take more time to produce crops because they refrain from using the chemicals and growth hormones used by conventional farmers.|['organic-environment', 'conventional-environment']|['n', 'p']

I also wonder if organic food is overpriced or is all conventional supermarket foods underpriced.|['organic-price', 'conventional-price']|['0', '0']
Organic foods cost more for one or more of 4 reasons.|['organic-price']|['n']
The other part is that often it takes more labor to grow organic food.|['organic-general']|['0']
So part of the cost goes to paying the farmer to grow that food for you organically.|['organic-price']|['0']
I think organic food is more expensive per unit to produce because the pesticides and herbicides used in modern farming (along with the mechanization) allow for more units to be produced per allotted space.|['organic-price']|['n']
So an acre of land farmed using modern practices may result in a greater bounty than an acre of land farmed organically.|['conventional-environment', 'organic-environment']|['p', 'n']
Another aspect is there is some degree of over pricing because people perceive greater value in organic food, and they are willing to pay for it.|['organic-price']|['n']
As owner of a business selling natural and organic products, I know I have competitors pricing products much higher than their costs of production.|['organic-price']|['n']
Mainly, organic products can't be subjected to pesticides/herbicides, synthetic hormones/antibiotics or chemical fertilizers.|['organic-general']|['0']
Losses are more likely, and yields tend to be less predictable.|['organic-environment']|['n']
It seems self-defeating to preserve organic food with inorganic preservative agents, so shelf-life is reduced while the cost of storage/transport is increased due to spoilage.|['organic-price']|['n']
Proponents of organic food argue that it's tastier and healthier, so that is an oppertunity to charge an additional premium.|['organic-experienced quality', 'organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-price']|['p', 'p', 'n']
I searched on internet as to why the cost is so much high than conventional even though natural substances are used.|['conventional-price']|['p']

I helped a buddy of mine on his organic farm in Indiana a few summers ago.|['organic-general']|['0']
There are ways that organic farmers can attempt to work with nature [instead of beating it into submission with chemicals], but it generally involves a lot of manual labor, which means more expensive produce [even when farm hands are paid $9/hour].|['organic-price']|['n']

For one, the cows are fed organic (no pesticide) feed and not given routine anti-biotics.|['organic-environment']|['p']
No antibiotics in their daily feed means they have to be fed mainly grass and are much healthier than corn-fed cows who get highly acidic and get all sorts of sores and ulcers and other nasty stuff (that's why the anti-biotics in daily feed).|['organic-environment']|['p']
No Rbst helps with this, as one reason to overfeed cows on corn is to pump them with artificial hormones to get more milk.|['organic-environment']|['p']
No hormones, less feed, less sores and disease in your milk cows and in your milk.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Milk concentrates pesticides because fat concentrates pesticides.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']

What is the certification log on on the product?|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Is it USDA certified organic?|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
The process of certification for organic foods that are USDA certified organic is regulated by the National Organic Program.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
There are many organizations that can certify foods as organic following the standard set by the NOP, which is under the US Department of Agriculture.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Eighty four certifying agents are currently USDA-accredited and authorized to certify operations to the USDA organic standards.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Of these, 49 are based in the U.S. and 35 are based in foreign countries.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Most certifying agents are directly accredited by the USDA National Organic Program (NOP).|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Twenty additional certifying agents are authorized through recognition agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
You can read more about this on the USDA - NOP program website: USDA Accredited Certifying Agents So yes, foods coming from Mexico can be certified organic.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
The USDA certification is a 3rd party independent certification, which means it's not the company producing the food that verifies that the food meets this standard, it's an independent 3rd party certification.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['p']
This is the highest standard and verification there is for an organic claim.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['p']
Yes, for the most part, Certified organic means there are no GMOs.|['GMO-general']|['n']
To be more exact: USDA Certified Organic has <5% GMOs.|['organic-general']|['p']
A small percentage is unavoidable.|['GMO-general']|['n']

"By definition, a GMO seed can't be grown using organic practices, since the seeds themselves are produced by ""excluded methods"", as defined in CFR § 205.2 : Excluded methods."|['GMO-environment']|['0']
A variety of methods used to genetically modify organisms or influence their growth and development by means that are not possible under natural conditions or processes and are not considered compatible with organic production.|['GMO-general']|['0']
As Justin Ma notes, there are concessions to the practicality of the fact that GMO foods are present in the food stream and so really are really kept low rather than eliminated.|['GMO-general']|['n']
"Of course we don't live in a perfect world, but for better or worse, GMOs are prohibited in ""Organic Products""."|['GMO-general']|['n']
"""Organic"" means different things to different people like uses of ""Natural Fertilizers"" or ""Natural Pesticides"" etc..., But, GMOs are banned: See the following' The use of genetic engineering, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs), is prohibited in organic products."|['GMO-general']|['0']
This means an organic farmer can’t plant GMO seeds, an organic cow can’t eat GMO alfalfa or corn, and an organic soup producer can’t use any GMO ingredients.|['organic-general']|['p']
To meet the USDA organic regulations, farmers and processors must show they aren’t using GMOs and that they are protecting their products from contact with prohibited substances, such as GMOs, from farm to table.|['organic-general']|['p']
Organic operations implement preventive practices based on site-specific risk factors, such as neighboring conventional farms or shared farm equipment or processing facilities.|['organic-general']|['0']
For example, some farmers plant their seeds early or late to avoid organic and GMO crops flowering at the same time (which can cause cross-pollination).|['organic-environment']|['0']
Others harvest crops prior to flowering or sign cooperative agreements with neighboring farms to avoid planting GMO crops next to organic ones.|['organic-environment']|['0']
Farmers also designate the edges of their land as a buffer zone where the land is managed organically, but the crops aren’t sold as organic.|['organic-environment']|['0']
Any shared farm or processing equipment must be thoroughly cleaned to prevent unintended exposure to GMOs or prohibited substances.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
You do know that GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organisms, right?|['GMO-general']|['n']
So you're asking if organic food has genetically modified organisms on it, similar to how I would ask if my pork is free of trichinosis parasites.|['GMO-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Now, given that organic foods aren't very strictly policed, and that most GMOs other than Monsanto corn do release pollen, I would guess that there's some cross breeding here or there.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Organic is a concept, hijacked to increase prices and gain marketing advantage.|['organic-general']|['n']
- Most corporations (like Monsanto and most others) distort data and flat out lie to make more profit.|['organic-general']|['n']

Other answers have very well explained why organic produce is costly in general.|['organic-environment']|['p']
But, most of the cultivable land in India is by default organic.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['p']
That means the cultivable land is not exposed to pesticides or fertilizers at all, like North eastern parts of India, where farmers don't have access to chemical solutions.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['p']
Moreover, Farmers have to pay nearly Rs.10,000 ($200) for a certification process in India and it may take upto 5 years to convert the soil for the full fledged organic crops production.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['p']
In short, organic farming uses bio fertilizers and costly methods for pest control like biological control agents.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
But, Why is it so expensive in India?|['organic-price']|['0']
India may account for 1 - 2% of the total organic produce worldwide.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
One of the main reason for organic products so expensive in India , is that the local market is not the target market for the organic farmers in India .|['organic-price']|['0']
Because, India exports 85% of its organic produce .|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
"Organic farmers in India eye the global market rather than the local market. """|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
"Around 60 per cent of the country’s organic products were exported to the European Union, 20 per cent to the US, 5 per cent to Japan and the rest to Canada, Australia and East Asian countries. """|['organic-general']|['0']

When they consider what to plant, the potential profit is a huge factor in the decision.|['organic-environment']|['0']
Organic crops will yield at least 30%-50% less than the same crop that is treated with chemicals.|['organic-environment']|['n']
That means that the farmer could potentially make half the profit of the conventional crop.|['organic-environment']|['n']
Since there are people who demand organic food, the farmer can justify doubling the cost of an organic crop.|['organic-price']|['0']
What the farmer risks is chemical residue from other fields contaminating his organic crop.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
If that happens, it can no longer be considered organic and he loses the price increase without gaining the benefits of the chemicals.|['organic-general']|['0']
Organic farmers have a pretty stressful job, and they should be compensated for that.|['organic-general']|['0']

100% I don’t want to let on that organic food is bad or any worse than conventionally farmed food.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
It’s basically no better or worse, so when I say “100% overrated”, I mean that all of the purported advantages amount to nothing (and in most cases, are actually just plain myths).|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
Now there is arguably some extent to which the myths about organic food were technically true when the movement first began about 45+ years ago, but they haven’t been for a very long time.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
That said, I would stop just short of saying that organic food is actually a fraudulent enterprise.|['organic-general']|['n']
The only reason I would stop just short of that is that I don’t believe that it is necessarily the intent of those in the industry to deliberately deceive the populace… however, it doesn’t make the emperor any less naked.|['organic-general']|['n']
Though there are groups like Greenpeace who do deliberately and brazenly lie to people about organic vs conventional and especially GMOs in the interest of advancing their agenda, but Greenpeace isn’t really an industry player.|['organic-general']|['n']
To distill it down to a single point — and yes, I know this will inevitably lead to an oversimplification, but that’s what will happen when you try to distill anything down to a single statement — Organic food is not a movement based on food value; it’s a movement based on revulsion of science of technology.|['organic-general']|['n']
The simple reason why it works is because the marketing message of organic food evokes fanciful imagery of the “olden days” against the fearsome images of poorly understood concepts of modern technology and the hatred of big megacorporate interests.|['organic-general']|['n']
It’s a marketing message that plays to people's atavistic fears of that which they don't fully understand.|['organic-general']|['n']
People think of technological advances in agriculture like GMOs and they picture mad scientists The latter of which is a bit hilarious since the organic food market isn’t dominated by your neighborhood farmers… it’s dominated by the likes of Wal-Mart, Costco, Kraft, Kellog’s, etc.|['organic-general']|['n']
First of all, let’s begin with the belief that organic food is better for you — that’s simply untrue.|['organic-general']|['n']
Actual studies show there is no advantage whatsoever when all else is equal.|['organic-general']|['n']
The variables that affect nutrient quality have more to do with conditions like soil management, disease, weather, etc… and that’s the case regardless of farming process.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
An organic tomato grown in Florida is going to have poorer nutrient quality to a conventional tomato grown in California — that’s just down to soil.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
Moreover, the techniques that farmers use to manage soil quality and account for weather and so on are the same for organic vs. conventional farming techniques.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
They’re actually the same techniques farmers have been using pretty much since the dawn of civilization — modern technology has merely improved the efficiency and scale at which they can do it.|['organic-general']|['n']
Let’s also remember that the farming industry isn’t one in which quality drives the economy; Quantity, on the other hand, does.|['organic-general']|['n']
More specifically, the money a farmer makes isn’t a function of nutrients or flavor.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
It’s a function of the total weight of yield.|['organic-general']|['n']
While an organic farmer can make a little more per kilo of yield, the total weight for a given amount of input labor and operating costs is less as well, so farmers don’t actually make good money on organic.|['organic-environment']|['n']
As far as taste/flavor goes, studies show that organic vs. conventional is basically a tie.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
Moreover, there are also studies that strongly indicate that the perceived flavor advantage of organic food is entirely down to expectations.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
In blind tests, things come out basically even (again, assuming all else equal), but if people are told that one is organic and one is conventional, the one they were told is organic tends to win, even if the subjects of the study were actually misled.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
Moreover, much like with MSG, if subjects were told that one was GMO and one was not, the subjects often experienced ill effects, again, even if they were lied to about it; The same subjects never experience that if they’re never informed in the first place.|['GMO-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Also, many people believe that organic food means no pesticides or herbicides.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
That’s actually a myth.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
What they’re not permitted to use is synthetic pesticides and herbicides.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
Natural ones are actually allowed (and there are several of these), and they are used in large quantities.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
As it so happens, this is actually less “green”, because naturally sourced pesticides and herbicides tend to carry all sorts of impurities, and offer lower efficacy, which actually means that organic farmers have to use more of it to get their yields up to manageable levels… Synthetic pesticides and herbicides are more effective, can be used in smaller quantities, and are higher purity, which actually makes them many times safer and cause less contaminated runoff.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
In fact, all outbreaks of food-borne illness from vegetables sold in the U.S. in the last 30 years have been connected exclusively to organic vegetables.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
The only legitimate illness prevention that organic offers (and more specifically, it’s only there in the sense that it is an explicit requirement of organic meats) is that livestock feed cannot contain any animal byproducts, which thereby reduces the risk of Mad Cow disease… there’s really nothing else you can explicitly tie to organic food.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Really, the only reason why people don’t realize this (or believe it if the facts are laid bare) is because of their atavistic response to the idea of synthetic chemicals and the idea that that makes them inherently harmful and that anything natural is inherently good.|['organic-general']|['0']
Similarly, the notion of no antibiotics or hormones in organic is also a myth.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
What it actually is that that there are no antibiotics or hormones used specifically for purposes other than to treat diseases and/or disorders.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
And also, any notion that these things are necessarily harmful betrays an inordinate ignorance about biochemistry, but that’s exactly why people fear it so much in the first place.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
There’s not even the slightest shade of evidence that these things actually affect humans in any way.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Also, a meat that is certified organic does not mean that all of the feed stock is organically grown; it’s around 80%, and exceptions can be made if there are known nutrient deficiencies in the feed stock.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
There are some people who believe that buying organic helps small or local farmers, and that too is a myth.|['organic-general']|['n']
As mentioned before, organic is now a huge industry, and it bears all the same “evil corporate” characteristics one would associate with conventional “factory” farming.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
You can support local growers by paying more at farmers markets, but one should take notice of the fact that this is actually a less environmentally sound approach.|['organic-environment']|['n']
Economies of scale actually make industrialized farming more eco-friendly overall.|['organic-environment']|['n']
While organic growers ostensibly make more per unit weight than conventional farmers, the fact that they're cut off from a host of technological advances means that it isn't even a theoretical possiblity for them to obtain equivalent yields on the same resource input.|['organic-environment']|['n']
It turns out in practice that for all farm owners who own both conventional and organic plots, they make less money per acre on organic (again, assuming apples to apples, of course).|['organic-environment']|['n']
There is some degree of correlation between organic and lower incidence of cruel treatment of livestock.|['organic-environment']|['p']
It's debatable how much of this is related to the political image maintenance of organic food, and how much is because it's merely possible since organic is still a smaller subset of the overall food market.|['organic-environment']|['0']
It should be known that everything we associate with so-called “factory” farming exists for one and only one reason — to meet market demand.|['conventional-environment']|['p']
That said, in spite of the propaganda campaigns, it should be also known that the horrifying images we've all seen are actually not as large an issue as demagogues would have you believe.|['organic-general']|['n']
Oh, they're real, but the statistics do not support any of the claims that some would have you believe.|['conventional-general']|['p']
Buying organic or pushing for cruelty-free practices in all kinds of farming?|['organic-general']|['n']
To a certain extent, I'm torn on this one since all dollars are infinitely more powerful than all votes, but to be able to pull it off requires a certain degree to which people at large need to be informed… which I'm fairly sure is never going to be possible.|['organic-general']|['n']
The price may be a bit inflated, but if it is truly organic and done right, then you truly can taste the difference.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
Unfortunately, most of the so-called organic foods sold at the health food markets aren't that great tasting.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
But when you get the truly premium stuff, man, it's like a whole different grade of food and you wonder what have you been putting in your mouth all these years.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
The environmental effects notwithstanding, as a food, it has to be better for you too because of the lack of chemicals.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Nobody has ever argued that more chemicals are good for you.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
No, There are real benefits of organic food for people and the environment.|['organic-environment']|['p']
It is important to do your homework when choosing what to buy.|['organic-general']|['p']
I do not trust the Government to regulate anything so companies and individuals need to self regulate so that consumers have trust in what they are purchasing.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']

Yes, this is apparent in Cuban public health statistics.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
It is very labor-intensive, as anyone who maintains even a small garden will testify.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
The main disadvantage IS government regulation and how that relates to economies of scale.|['organic-general']|['0']
Farms large and small that exist to distribute food publicly have so many federal regulations on them that the small farmer really struggles to survive these days.|['organic-price']|['0']
Regulation fees are far out of whack for small farmers who often have to pay the same rates as giant corporate farms.|['organic-environment']|['0']
The government has nearly regulated the small local farmer out of business.|['organic-environment']|['0']
This is the most notable in organic food which must pay extra regulation fees to use the term “organic”.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
People think organic food is more expensive because of the scale and business model of the small farmer.|['organic-price']|['0']
The main reason organic food costs more is because of the fees the federal government charges to use the term organic.|['organic-price']|['0']
These fees eat so deep into the small farmers profit lines that they end up needing to charge higher prices to survive.|['organic-environment']|['0']
Have no doubt about it – the main disadvantage a local farmer has is the federal government applying high regulation fees that only corporate farms can afford and still make a good living.|['organic-price']|['n']
A large majority of cows (in the US anyway) are fed corn at some point if not at all points of their life.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Cows don't know they're organic and nowhere in organic standards set by the NOP are there any rules on what species and varieties of crops can be fed as long as they're not GMO and grown under organic practices.|['GMO-general']|['n']
What I'm saying is that it really doesn't matter what scale of organic farming we're talking cows are likely to be eating at least some corn.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
Corn has had billions of dollars invested into advancing its yields and quality as a feed crop in the last couple centuries.|['conventional-general']|['0']
Its considerably more profitable to grow than many other crops even if under organic management you can only grow it in the rotation every 2-4 years on a field at best.|['organic-environment']|['n']
corn field = 18-20 ton/ac.|['conventional-environment']|['0']
Equipment for handling corn is readily available in most agricultural areas meaning farmers don't have to buy special equipment to plant, tend or harvest it and can easily share with neighbors.|['organic-environment']|['0']
Legumes such as alfalfa and rich early summer pasture match very well with corn silage nutritionally for cows because they are high in protein but low in fiber.|['conventional-experienced quality']|['p']
Corn silage has lots of fiber and energy in the form of starch that microbes in a cow's rumen use in conjunction with the protein and sugars to make milk and keep the cows blood urea levels in check.|['conventional-environment']|['p']
It's a 1+1=3 kind of deal.|['conventional-environment']|['p']
Can you plant a pasture mix that combines all those nutrients important for cow's microbes that would be a complete feed needing no supplemental corn?|['organic-environment']|['n']
Yes, but it's not always the easiest thing to do for a host of reasons.|['organic-environment']|['n']
For farms that buy feed from other farmers because they have limited land, concentrated energy in the form of grains is often the most efficient thing to ship on a lbs of milk / $ of shipping cost.|['conventional-environment']|['p']
industrial organic food system should also consider sheanut cake/meal as a feed material.|['organic-general']|['0']
Organic tea is more beneficial for health because it does not contain any chemicals while non organic tea contains chemicals when consumed it enters the body and have adverse effects.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']

Though the chemicals are used in very less amount still some amount of residue is left over which have an adverse effect after consumption.therefore prefer not to have inorganic teas.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']

I eat an almost 100% organic food diet and I'm reasonably certain that I have benefited from it but I still can't give an unqualified yes to this question.|['organic-general']|['p']
There are several problems with organic standards and certification.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
Organic food used to be produced by small-scale farmers who grew incredibly high quality produce without using any toxic chemicals.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
In the last 15 years that has changed and organics is now largely out of control of farmers and firmly in the hands of the certifying bodies (such as the USDA in america) and the huge companies that have largely taken over the organic food market.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Here is a bit of a catch up on the current state of the union when it comes to organic food.|['organic-general']|['0']
First The Bad News 1.|['organic-general']|['n']
In many cases organic certification represents a minimum standard that farmers (and big-agriculture companies) use as a checklist in order to put an official stamp on their product and then command a higher price for food that isn't much different to conventional produce.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
Their products meet the letter of the law but not the spirit of it.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
One example from about 15 years ago in the USA was Horizon Dairy which had previously been a conventional dairy using hormones, antibiotics, and feeding their cows non-organic feed.|['conventional-general']|['0']
The USDA published their guidelines for organic certification in 2000 and Horizon (along with many other huge food operations) saw massive profits to be made and switched their cows to organic feed, stopped giving them hormones and hey presto they were now organic certified.|['organic-general']|['0']
The problem was that they were a massive feedlot operation and were only barely meeting minimum standards to be certified.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
* Their cows had the absolute minimum access to pasture and were just being shoveled massive piles of organic corn feed rather than conventional corn feed.|['organic-environment']|['n']
They were now on an even playing field on store shelves with more legitimate companies like Organic Valley which was a co-operative of smaller farms that were operated much more like what we all imagine an organic dairy farm to look like.|['organic-general']|['0']
I could give countless other examples of companies that did similar things such as Cascadian farms, and the Hain Celestial group.|['organic-general']|['0']
If you live in the USA you can walk in to a Sam's Club or a Wal-Mart and see huge tubs of store-brand, organic produce that's often farmed in China on massive farms that spray organic fertilizers, use organic certified pesticides, and pay low wages that would be illegal in the USA.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
The distinction between some of the organic and conventional foods on these store-shelves is going to be superficial at best.|['organic-general']|['n']
Organic Standards are massively different in different countries.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Behind the scenes there is constant jockeying by pesticide and fertilizer companies to get their products listed as certified organic.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
There are pesticides that you can spray on your crops in the USA and still get your certified label that would cause you to lose your certification in Australia and vice versa.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Other farming practices suffer from the same arbitrariness between nations.|['organic-general']|['0']
Multibillion-dollar companies are now heavily invested in organic foods.|['organic-general']|['0']
These include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, Whole Foods, and The Coca-Cola Company amongst many others.|['organic-general']|['0']
As a result of being stakeholders in organic standards they lobby the certifying bodies whenever organic standards come under periodic review.|['organic-general']|['0']
In many cases these companies have campaigned to weaken organic standards and allow conventional farming practices to creep into their operations and still get the all-important organic label.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
It is not that these companies are evil it's just that organic farming is inherently more costly than conventional farming.|['organic-environment']|['0']
Their economic incentives are to try to reduce the costs of organic farming while still commanding the higher price that an organic label will get them.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
The Good News It is possible to eat food that is organic in the old sense of the word, grown by farmers who have integrity and seek to grow food without spraying them with horrible poisons.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
** You have to do your research though and look at organic certification as the baseline minimum standard rather than the final word on food safety.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
As Evita Ochel points out there is solid research showing benefits from eating organic foods despite all these compromises that have been made to organic standards.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
If you have farmer's markets in your area I highly recommend going to them and getting to know farmers in your area.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Ask them if they actually grow the food they are selling or if they are a reseller.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Ask them if they grow organically.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
If you shop at big retailers like Whole Foods or a regular supermarket selling organic food look at the labels carefully.|['conventional-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Google the brands of food you are buying and find out if there are controversies involved in their ingredients.|['conventional-trustworthy sources']|['0']

Avoiding this one chemical is reason enough to eat organic.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Yes, yes, and more yes!|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
In addition to the wonderful points in the answer made by Michele Trainer , there has been increasing research over the past few years especially shedding light on the importance of eating organic.|['organic-general']|['p']
"Here is one example that examined many studies: Page on ncl.ac.uk “We carried out meta-analyses based on 343 peer-reviewed publications that indicate statistically significant and meaningful differences in composition between organic and non-organic crops/crop-based foods” Other research and a simple example is available in the book ""Toxin Toxout"" by Lourie & Smith, whose simple experiment demonstrated how much pesticide levels fell in children's bodies when eating solely organic, and how much they rose again when given conventional food."|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
"Because pesticides, asides from the blatant risks some of them pose to our health, and no matter how ""generally recognized as safe"" anyone says they are, are not ideal substances for the human body."|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Some are linked to being carcinogenic, others neurotoxins, others yet to problems with immune health, weight, intestinal health, etc.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Why would anyone who cares about their health want to put more stress on the body?|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Especially today, when so many things cause so much stress as it is.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
We have to remember that at the end of the day, it is all about a cumulative effect.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
While one pesticide may not do much harm, the risks increase significantly when we consider the consumption of many of them together, on a regular basis, and over a long period of our lifetime.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
And NO ONE can guarantee you their safety when synergistic effects are considered.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Yes, they may test one pesticide in isolation and claim that it seems to be safe, but what happens when it interacts with other pesticides or chemical compounds?|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Unfortunately such tests don't exist, as our body, our food, and life is too dynamic.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
When in doubt about organics, we simply need to ask ourselves: does it feel/seem right to eat food that has been naturally grown or chemically grown?|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
For me, the answer is simple and clear.|['organic-general']|['p']
In fact organics have inspired me to grow some of my own food, as the differences in flavor alone are huge and so worth it!|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
And if someone eats animal products, not just plants, then there is even more at stake given how animals are raised today on drugs, and GMO and pesticide-based foods.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
And when we start thinking a little more globally, and consider the effects of eating organic on more than just ourselves, then we find that many more reasons to go organic.|['organic-general']|['p']
My impression is that for the most part, it doesn't make a difference.|['organic-general']|['n']
Macro changes to your diet matter much more in practice - that is, eating fewer potatoes, rice, pasta, etc and eating more fruits and veggies.|['conventional-general']|['0']
The main place where it really seems to matter is in animal products - dairy and meat.|['organic-general']|['0']
In those cases, aim not for organic but naturally raised.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Grass-fed meat and pastured eggs for example.|['organic-general']|['0']
The main reason is that animal products concentrate nutrients and will be far more nutritious.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
They also concentrate toxins like pesticides and their higher fat content increases the likelihood that you'll absorb more of it.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
By the same argument, you might also consider organic for oils.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
"USDA-FDA.com Nutritional Labeling, USDA Label Expeditor, Facility Consultant, UPC Barcodes The USDA defines certain criteria for food sold in the US with the label ""Organic""."|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
It essentially states that the farmers used natural manure instead of processed chemical fertilizers, uses pest management techniques that do not rely on lab-made pesticides and herbicides, and use livestock disease management practices that are not reliant on antibiotics.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
However, the USDA makes no claims, and in fact states that there is no evidence, to whether or not organic food is healthier, safer, or more nutritious.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
From first hand experience, I can tell you that organic vegetables are more likely to have pest damage.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
The first time I bought organic, I bought a zucchini, and sliced it in half right through a worm that had apparently been living inside it.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
People have a common perception that organic vegetables are larger and healthier, but this is due to selection bias.|['organic-experienced quality']|['n']
Grocery stores that sell a lot of organic vegetables tend to be more expensive and have tighter selection criteria.|['organic-price']|['p']
I regularly attend one of the largest farmer-only farmer's markets in the US, and the organic crops are typically pitiful compared to the commercially fertilized ones.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
Why would commercial growers pay for all the research and development that goes into commercial fertilizers if they could make bigger and better vegetables with cow crap?|['organic-environment']|['n']
"There have also been some high profile news cases lately where ""organic"" farms turned out to be getting a lot of runoff from traditional commercial farms."|['organic-general']|['n']
Until just a couple of years ago, there was no regulation at all and anyone could call their produce organic.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
My advice is that if you're really worried about the quality of your produce, stop buying into marketing hype and get to know your local farmers.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
My wife and I have eaten mostly organic for years.|['organic-general']|['p']
But it is difficult to pinpoint exactly why we feel that we have personally experienced benefits.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
We have a lot of energy.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
But you could blame this on our regular exercise program that we are also doing.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']

Detailed blood tests remain very good including triglycerides, LDL and HDL cholesterol.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Conceptually we feel that we do not want to poison ourselves with regular food, so we buy organic.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
We are aware that this may be not the perfect answer, but it is a better answer than going to fast food restaurants every day.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
We rather cook organic at home.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
The only benefot is making a company rich and draining your bank account.|['organic-price']|['n']
Well you can loose weight by eating organic because you are more likely to contract a food borne illnesses from organics than you are from normal food.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
I am half and half on veggie/fruit but try to be 100% organic when it comes to dairy and meat.|['organic-general']|['p']
Like James mentioned, organic milk does seem to have a longer expiration date.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
Also, I noticed organic chicken has better texture which actually makes cooking easier.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
Of course budget wise, you'll end up spend more $$ but psychologically speaking, it does help me feel better about my health.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
I have been on this semi-organic diet for about 3 months now and I think I'd like to continue because I do value the $$ I put into my diet and see it as my investment for health.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Taking budget and availability into consideration, I can't go 100% organic.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
I will if I am able.|['organic-general']|['p']
That's why I prioritized my list with diary and meat products on top.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['p']
And no offense at my observation, but I do see how it can be effective if you truly believe that organic food is substantially different.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
When you buy organic produce and meat what do you look for on the package?|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
USDA Certified Organic stamp, Non-GMO label, no antibiotic included/grass feed...For fruits/veggie, grocery stores usually have the organic section pointed out and you can see all the produce there have the same 9xxx series code.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']

Aren't there better ways to evaluate a relatively minor trend in eating as organic etc.|['organic-general']|['0']
The answer to your specific question is no, there has not been a noticeable impact yet.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
I don't see it, for the simple reason that most people are still accepting marketing initiatives as their primary source of nutrition education.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
Marketing exists to make money for shareholders, not to benefit people.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
"For this reason, consumers accept that a product is ""organic"", ""natural"" and so forth because a label says so, without regard for what those terms mean in the legal context, in the context of the FDA and USDA, or what *other* ingredients are in the box."|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
In other words, people are not yet eating food the way Earth delivers it to us.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
So long as our primary source of food is boxes, bags and cans, we are unlikely to see any significant improvement in the health of the general population.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Although I appreciate the movements toward better food choices, like organic and locally sourced, we also have more unlabeled GMO foods (refined oils, soy, corn, tomatoes, etc., and ever more junk and processed foods around.|['GMO-general']|['n']
If you look at most grocery stores, dairy, fish, meats and fresh produce tend to be along the perimeter while the center isles (the bulk of the offerings) are filled with soda, cookies, candy, crackers, breads, and tons of packaged and processed foods.|['conventional-general']|['n']
So, unfortunately, I don't think there is a big impact yet, and lifestyle-driven chronic disease (heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, strokes, cancers, joint problems and pain, mood disorders, etc.)|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
I do like the direction of organic and healthier, whole foods.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
I also think those who choose those foods will benefit with better health and less disease!|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']

I will only pay the extra if it has a 3rd party stamp from an IOAS accredited organic producer - the USDA is watered down and almost meaningless.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
But, I think what you may be after is that the margins are slightly better but narrowing compared to conventional techniques.|['organic-general']|['0']
There are huge commercial farms that have lobbied for and diluted the original definitions proposed for organics, and produce large quantities of produce on a maginally better margin than their conventional crops because their process isn't much differentiated.|['organic-general']|['n']

Is Organic More Nutritious?|['organic-experienced quality']|['0']
New Study Adds To The Evidence .|['organic-experienced quality']|['0']
Modern factory farming utilizes other innovations that do affect the product.|['conventional-general']|['n']
First, ripeness affects content.|['organic-general']|['0']
Fruits that ripen on the plant generally do have more vitamins and a different balance of sugars, fats, proteins, etc., than fruits that are picked when unripe and then ripened over time or with chemical stimulation.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
So if your organic fruit comes from a local farm, it probably is slightly more nutritious and almost certainly tastes better.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
Second, choice of variety has systematic effects on nutritional content.|['organic-experienced quality']|['0']
Conventional varieties have been bred (or genetically modified) to maximize profits for the grower.|['GMO-general']|['n']
For the most part, this means attracting consumers by being high in sugar and low in fiber, probably thick of skin and small of seed, extremely quick to grow on the plant but slow to ripen.|['conventional-general']|['0']

It is believed that reduced pest pressure, higher nitrogen and rapid plant growth – all common in conventional agriculture – reduce plant antioxidant production.|['conventional-experienced quality']|['0']
In other words, plants need stress from pests, do not need agricultural fertilizers heavy in nitrogen and do need to grow at their own life cycle’s pace to produce the healthiest, more antioxidant-rich fruits and leaves (Benbrook et al., 2008).|['organic-experienced quality']|['0']

There are 10 milligrams of known carcinogens in a cup of coffee and that's more carcinogens than you're likely to get from pesticide residues for a year!|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
We're eating natural pesticides, which are natural chemicals that plants use to try to kill off insects that try to eat them.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
And we eat roughly 1,500 milligrams of them per day.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
We eat 0.09 milligrams of synthetic pesticide residues.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']

Organic food is healthier, however it is not a well known piece of information simply because the earth cannot support 7billion people organically, therefore the consensus must be non-organic is healthy otherwise you would have mass panic and reprisals.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
The problem stems to the fact that issues arising from non-organic farming manifests themselves as lifestyle diseases and various other factors which cumulate over years and decades, not days or weeks.|['conventional-general']|['n']
It therefore integrates it to society and cannot be tested to be inferior, over a decade many factors can come in to play so no one can pinpoint the cause, hence non-organic is deemed as safe.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['0']
There will be a few select cases that can prove organic is healthier but as there are so few, you need a 100% consistent lifestyle which few have, they become diluted in the crowd.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']

You then have the water sources, which contain chemical chlorine and salt where only reverse osmosis can filter them, however that process also removes the ‘good’ minerals, The Netherlands is one of the few places that used natural filtration.|['conventional-general']|['n']
Given that 1ltr of water can contain the equivalent of 1.25g of table salt via sodium, over a long period it can be very damaging.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']

Anyone who trusts anything labeled as organic is either misinformed, or they just like the taste of feces.|['organic-general']|['n']
If a product is labeled organic then there are rigid standards to follow.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
In simple terms organic refers to food that is grown without chemical fertilizers and pesticides which is theoretically better for your health since the body's immune system does not have to work so hard to remove these toxins ingested with the food; and also the soil condition is enhanced with natural composting methods which makes a healthier bio-system for microorganisms, insects and all creatures living downstream or upwind.|['organic-general']|['p']
When you buy organic food you are paying for food clean from undesirable toxins and also paying the farmer to be a good caretaker of the land.|['organic-experienced quality', 'organic-environment']|['p', 'p']
On the other hand, use of chemical fertilizers tends to deplete the soil over time and the use of pesticides kills even beneficial insects, micro-organisms in the soil, can negatively effect birds and often ends up in the streams and rivers, polluting the entire food chain.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
Chemical fertilizers and pesticides are petroleum by-products so further dependency on gas and oil is maintained.|['conventional-environment']|['n']

Organic food is in nowadays.|['organic-general']|['p']
With a lot more people choosing to live the healthy life, it’s quite normal to have people making healthier food choices.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
If yes is your answer, then you must learn to develop a loving relationship with organic food.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
Organic food is the way to go when living a healthy life – it’s not only agriculturally grown in the most environmentally sensitive manner, it also shields you from harmful toxins often associated with genetically modified organisms and conventionally grown foods.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Organic Food Versus Genetically Modified Organisms Organic Food Production Is Better Organic Food is an Excellent Food Choice If you want the best source of organic food in Singapore, you’re in the right place!|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['p']
Nature’s Glory is the name you can trust when it comes to organic food supply and delivery.|['organic-general']|['p']
Most people think they should do it for health benefit reasons - honestly, what you eat is a much bigger impact then any slight change between organic and conventional would have, where it even has a change.|['organic-general']|['0']
I’m fine with people believing it wrongly, however, since Organic is better for the environment.|['organic-environment']|['p']
It generally has lower soil erosion (a huge issues), lower uses of fertilizers - especially nitrogen fertilizers (which lead to algae blooms and has strong negative impacts on local water ways), low fossil fuel use, better sustainability towards droughts, etc etc etc.|['organic-environment']|['p']
The pro-GMO side tends to get wrong how much of a yield increase GMOs do (5% vs best organic practices, 15% normally, 25% vs worst organic practices - to put it into perspective, 50% of food globally spoils, and just eating cattle is 12x more expensive then eating veggies), they tend to get wrong what *IS* GMOed (the amount of people who think it’s 90% stuff like golden rice aren’t rare), etc etc.|['GMO-general']|['0']
The pro-Organic side tends to think that organic uses no pesticide (they do, often shorter lived but more toxic ones), and the fact that it does take more people to farm organic then conventional.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
Because I find any conversation about organic or conventional that doesn’t mention LED grow farms is basically partisan hackery that leans towards big-agri or big-organic.|['organic-general']|['0']

But it’s not as if pesticide use has always been harmless.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
And the environmental impact of “organic” is worse.|['organic-environment']|['0']
The same argument can be made for “local” which also may or may not have more/less of an environmental impact.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Is organic food healthier?|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
In general, it is not demonstrated that organic food is healthier than conventional food.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
Research on individual products shows that organic products are generally less residues of pesticides contain and sometimes less nitrates than conventional products.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Both regular and organic products are safe to use.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']

I eat organically because the food resourced from trusted sources, and they are less harmful for the environment.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Most importantly, for me, organic farming is giving me guilt-free feeling, when it comes the treatments of the animals and plants involved.|['organic-environment']|['p']
The only reason why I eat organic food is to limit the chemicals that get inside my body.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
When it comes to produce - organic means grown without the use of pesticides (“pesticides” here being a broad term that actually includes fungicides, herbicides, etc.).|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
There is such an exorbitant amount of such chemicals dumped onto the fields throughout the world that it actually gets me worried that I can get some even while eating organic (but at least I am trying to limit the exposure as much as possible).|['conventional-environment']|['n']
One of the most profound effects of such pesticides is alteration of intestinal flora - which can and does lead to many problems, ranging from fat gain to mental disorders.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Let alone the fact that some of the chemicals used in pesticides are, by themselves, known toxic carcinogens.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
When it comes to animal products, organic to me means all that (i.e.|['organic-general']|['0']
- the animal was not fed pesticide-laden GMO crap) plus absence of added hormones and antibiotics, which contribute their own fair share of problems and diseases.|['organic-environment']|['p']
This means healthier animal who was not artificially “bulked up” to bring it to the market faster.|['organic-environment']|['p']
This means better quality meat and, more importantly, better quality fat.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
Organic is what normal food should have been all along.|['organic-general']|['p']
Unfortunately, mega-corporations who only have monetary interests at heart continue to do everything they can to destroy this concept.|['organic-general']|['0']
Is organic food really good for you?|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
While, as already metioned, that eating organic products usually prevent or at least deminish your intake of pesticides, hormones, antibiotics etc.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Another good reason for eating organic foods is for ethical reasons.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Fruits and vegetables produced conventionally on monoculture farms, can be very destructive especially towards wild fauna and flora.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
The pesticides kill the bees, the overuse of synthetic fertilisers poison the rivers and lakes/oceans they wash into, causing massive ‘dead zones’ and/or algae blooms.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
Also the hired labour to spay the fields with pesticides (usually for a terrible pay) often gets cancer, due to the carcinogens in the pesticide, and cannot pay for the treatment, due to the shit pay.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Lastly, the ethics concerning the treatment of factory-farmed animals.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
Many vegitarians and vegans could probably list many books and websites that explain and show all the horrific things that take place in these factories(these places are not farms) that mass produce beef, pork, chicken etc., but I am neither and will just compare it will organic animal husbandry practices.|['organic-environment']|['0']
In conventional egg production the chicken lives it's entire life in a tiny cage(typically 2–4 in each cage), often for two years enforce they are slaughtered for chick stock or dog food.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
The meat is not good enough to be directly served to humans.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
They often lose all their feathers due to stress and diseases and do not always live to be two years.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
The life of the meat chickens aren't much better.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
The breed of chicken used for meat has typically been bread to be as large as possible.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
This means that when they grow out to their full potential, they get to heavy for their own legs to carry them, so the legs break.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
These chicken live thousands cramped together in a huge hall.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
Pretty much living on top of each other.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
The pork and beef industry ain't much better either.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
The same goes on where the animals live in tiny cages and gets fed the cheapest possible food out there.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
And due to their proneness to catching diseases(because they were weaned so early and because they live so close together ), they get pumped full of antibiotics, which in turn create superbugs that can't be killed.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
I believe the first case of a human ‘catching’ an superbug that antibiotics couldn't kill was in the states last week.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Organic farming on the other hand, treats it's animals and treats nature with more consideration.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Nature does not get hit and damaged by the use of pesticides, synthetic fertilisers in the same way.|['organic-environment']|['p']
The animals are treated better considering feed, space to roam(often outside, they don't spend their whole life in cages without even seeing the sky), and companionship(by this I mean that the animals often stay with their mothers longer and live of her milk.|['organic-environment']|['p']
This has a lot of benifits regarding the creatures health).|['organic-environment']|['p']
All in all, it is my belief that if we breed creatures for the sole purpose of eating them, then the only ethical path is to treat them right, make sure they have had a decent life and treated with respect before we kill them.|['conventional-environment']|['n']
Because generally all food is organic.|['organic-general']|['0']
You can’t really escape those organic molecules, like carbohydrates for example.|['organic-general']|['0']
Eating non-organic food would mean that you live on stuff like water, salt and sand.|['organic-general']|['0']
Contrary to popular belief, “organic” can actually be worse on the environment, and also be more “dangerous” to consume (depending on your definition of “dangerous”, of course.|['organic-environment']|['n']
Organic farming does not achieve the same yields as more modern farming techniques, so more land is used to grow the same amount of food.|['organic-environment']|['n']
Couple that with the odd definitions of organic in many countries and it often means that harsher, less targeted poisons (like Rotenone) are used for pest control, because they are more “natural”.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
In fact some of the most toxic substances known to man are found in nature.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
Because these pesticides are less targeted, they have a tendency to cause a much greater environmental effect, like killing of beneficial predator species, often resulting in a *higher* usage of pesticides than in a non organic farm.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Non organic farms can use an engineered pesticide that more effectively targets just the pest species.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['p']
This helps reduce the impact on beneficial species, which means less pesticide has to be used for the same pest species reduction.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['p']
This can result in less over all environmental impact for a given unit of food.|['conventional-environment']|['p']
You can of course find local organic farms that use no pesticides whatsoever, just don’t expect to find their produce on the shelf at Safeway, because the food will not be all that attractive to your average consumer.|['organic-experienced quality']|['0']
Now there are of course some very good benefits to organic food as well.|['organic-general']|['p']
Organic foods usually have a wider variety of cultivars, resulting in more variety of taste and texture for a given food type.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']
But these benefits are not really heath based, they are more quality based.|['organic-experienced quality']|['p']

And if that still matters to you, then why do you not object to the chemicals on the list of approved organic pesticides?|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
What on earth makes you think I don’t object to “approved organic pesticides?” I don’t use any, not Neem oil, not Rotenone, I approve of ladybugs and Braconid wasps, and I give my cat free reign to kill any moles or mice he finds in the garden, that’s about it.|['organic-general']|['0']
The question was “Why is it imperative to you to eat organic food?”.|['organic-general']|['0']
A basket of fruit and vegetables, a pesticide and an insecticide and said that you’d only make your food from one.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
Because the question was about why you should eat organic food, I drew the assumption (perhaps wrongly) that the pictures referred to your thoughts on the question and that you thought conventional food is bad because it contains pesticides and inseciticides and organic food does not.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
First, I already clarified by stating that I use neither synthetic nor organic chemicals on my garden; see above.|['organic-general']|['0']
Third, assurances as to the “benign nature” of industrial or even natural chemicals to dump on food aren’t comforting as the same types of assurances were given in the past for the use of DDT, Agent Orange, Thalidomide, prenatal X-Rays, oxygen in the bassinets of premature babies, and mercury flushed into sewage systems.|['conventional-general']|['0']
Among the reasons your assumption about the levels of insecticide and herbicide/fungicide in food are flat out incorrect is that the amounts published by manufacturers are estimated based on (1) assumption of minimum levels used on fields (2) assumption that it will rain one or more times prior to harvest thus “washing off” the crops (3) Assumption that crops go from harvest to mouths, without intermediate steps where more chemicals will be applied.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Among the ways in which (3) was shown to be incorrect if you take time to read the literature, is that the manufacturer’s numbers didn’t include possible stabilization of the pesticide by additional coatings of other chemicals such as Alar which was used to delay ripening of apples.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Nor do the manufacturer’s numbers include post-harvest application of chemicals which include organophosphates including malathion, pirimiphos-methyl, fenitrothion and chlorpyrifosmethyl, or pyrethroids such as permethrin, deltamethrin and (in Australia) bioresmethrin and fumigation with methyl bromide.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
These chemicals are applied to crops stored in warehouses and thus will NOT be washed off.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n']
The net sum is that regular consumers of foods produced under these methods may suffer from “chronic toxicity through ingestion of small quantities of pesticide over a long period” [Halliday] Occurrence, sources and toxicological significance of pesticide residues in food grains One of the leading grain science professors in the world, Dr. Subramanyam Bhadriraju, chaired professor at Kansas State, points out the dangers and failings of your assumptions about the levels and dangers of these chemicals in grains and the application of them in grain elevators that is not accounted for in the USDA/NASS numbers.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['0']

In chemistry terms, all food is indeed organic, since the chemical definition of organic is a compound based on carbon: “Chemically, any compound containing carbon, with the exception of carbonates and cyanides.” (source: Oxford Dictionary of Chemistry) Some biology sources have defined organic as “of, pertaining to, or derived from an organism or organisms” (e.g.|['organic-general']|['0']

People generally don’t buy Organic Food because of two reasons: High Cost Trust for the Organic Brand for which high price is paid.|['organic-price']|['n']
Let me tell you first why Organic Food is expensive?|['organic-price']|['0']
Organic food supply is limited as compared to demand; Production costs for organic foods are typically higher because of greater labour inputs per unit of output Post-harvest handling of relatively small quantities of organic foods results in higher costs because of the mandatory segregation of organic and conventional produce, especially for processing and transportation; Marketing and the distribution chain for organic products is relatively inefficient and costs are higher because of relatively small volumes.|['organic-general']|['0']
In order to trust the Organic Brand you should check the norms (international and national)- like NPOP, USDA, etc - which have set the standards and which conform to these guidelines and certify producers.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']

Also, for a country like India, where there are many farmers who have very small land holdings and not good access to information and funds - it might never be possible for many farmers to get the certification despite having organic practices in their farming (I personally know 4 such farmers who practice organic just because they believe in it and they do not find it important for someone else to 'certify' their produce)...

What is organic farming?|['organic-general']|['0']
Lets define exactly what “organic farming” means.|['organic-general']|['0']
It really boils down to what “organic” methods are being used to produce food, fiber, energy.|['organic-general']|['0']
Definition #1“Organic meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy products come from animals that are given no antibiotics or growth hormones.|['organic-environment']|['p']
Organic food is produced without using most conventional pesticides; fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients or sewage sludge; bioengineering; or ionizing radiation.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']

(Or in the case of animal husbandry, organic non-GMO corn and soy is substituted for conventionally raised corn and soy and no antibiotics/hormones used.)|['organic-general']|['0']
This is the lowest quality version of organic and while you do have fewer pesticide residues and fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens, the nutritional quality is usually very close to the same.|['organic-experienced quality', 'organic-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'p']
On the other hand this version of organic really was invented to meet certain regulatory guidelines and many organic growers don’t even consider it “organic” at all.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['p']
Just a cheap imitation of organic designed to command a higher price at market and meet that consumer demand.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
I personally call this “substitution organic”, and its main benefit is that a farmer can convert to this easily without much in the way of new training or equipment.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
Others have termed this Organic 101, or phase 1 organic, the bare minimum basics.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
Definition #2 “Organic agriculture is an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity.|['organic-general']|['0']
It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain and enhance ecological harmony.” USDA National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) definition, April 1995 This definition more closely resembles what organic meant prior to the government and the certification boards taking control.|['organic-general']|['0']
And much faster than “substitution organic”.|['organic-general']|['0']
Others have called this Organic 201 or phase 2 Organic.|['organic-general']|['0']

Unfortunately, “sustainable” food sources are mostly theoretical in the modern world.|['organic-general']|['0']
That is pretty difficult to answer, as “all the pesticides” used in conventional farming add up to many, many different kinds of chemical treatments, some with more residual activity in the environment than others, some more toxic than others.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
But rather than get into so many details, I would pose the question back to you: What about all the pesticides used in organic farming?|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
If you are thinking that organic farming somehow equates to clean and happy and safe and natural food, think again.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
For the majority of organic food out there, all it means is that a “natural” chemical pesticide has been substituted for a synthetic version.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Often times those “organic” pesticides are in fact far more harmful to the environment than their synthetic counterparts.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Industrial organic farming (the vast majority out there) is still industrial farming and still has a pretty comparable effect on the environment in terms of energy use, chemical use, and soil treatment, largely because actual growing methods haven’t really been changed.|['conventional-general']|['0']
Organic, sadly, don’t mean much.|['organic-general']|['n']
The point I am trying to make is that where your pesticides come from—organic or synthetic sources—does not change the fact that this method of growing (industrial, including organic industrial) relies heavily on chemical use either way.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']

I also don't have any data to support my opinion, but I wholly agree with Alexandra that feeding your children organic food is something you cannot put a price on.|['organic-general']|['p']
Non-organic produce has so many chemicals and toxins that the consumption of them will definitely effect a person's health in the long run, especially in small children.|['conventional-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'n']

Organic food is grown without artificial chemicals and buying it is beneficial for two main reasons.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Number one is that you are not slowly poisoning yourself and the people you're serving (which if they are small children - are much more sensitive to these things and it's probably more likely to affect their development).|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'p']
You're not deliberately putting toxins in their mouths that their body should not be exposed to for optimal health.|['conventional-safety and healthiness', 'organic-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'p']
Glyphosate being the most popular and one of the most harmful offenders, has been linked to countless diseases including cancer and neural problems.|['conventional-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'n']
The second reason is that you are voting organic.|['organic-general']|['p']

Buying organic means you're not supporting companies who think it's okay to poison the earth (us humans included).|['conventional-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-environment']|['n', 'n']
So, this is more of a question regarding whether or not you personally think it's worth it not to consume toxins and support better agriculture methods.|['conventional-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness', 'organic-general']|['n', 'n', 'p']

This question probably makes the assumption that organic food has quality or health benefits.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-experienced quality']|['0', '0']
The answer is clearly a no.|['organic-general']|['n']
Several comprehensive reviews support the view that there are no nutritional or health benefits from organic products.|['organic-experienced quality', 'organic-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'n']
I lay them out in my post here: Organic vs conventional food Quality-wise, people may argue they can taste the difference.|['organic-experienced quality']|['0']
This, however, is a poor way to truly determine nutrition or truly, even taste perception, as being told the food is organic makes people rate it higher .|['organic-experienced quality', 'organic-experienced quality']|['n', 'n']
Firstly, it's important to note that organic farmers also use pesticides, and conventional farmers also minimise pesticide use through Integrated Pest Management ( IPM , natural predator insects, crop rotation, cover crops, etc).|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'p']
What comes to health risks from pesticides for the consumer, they are actually very small , and people fear them much out of proportion.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['p']
In this regard organic pesticides are no more benign than conventional , you can see comparisons with conventional and organic pesticides and other everyday chemicals in a table in this post: The dose makes the poison.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['0', '0']
It turns out, when they looked at natural vs synthetic chemicals in general, researchers have come to the conclusion that natural or not does not make a big difference.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['0', '0']
A comment on that study: Until recently, nobody bothered to look at natural chemicals (such as organic pesticides), because it was assumed that they posed little risk.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
But when the studies were done, the results were somewhat shocking: you find that about half of the natural chemicals studied are carcinogenic as well.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'n']
We assumed that “natural” chemicals were automatically better and safer than synthetic materials, and we were wrong.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
More on organic vs synthetic pesticides: Some organic approved pesticides are very benign (low hazard) materials, but so are a great many of the synthetic pesticides used by conventional farmers.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'p']
Some organic-approved pesticides are slightly to moderately toxic.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']

There are many pesticides that are used by both conventional and organic growers.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['0', '0']
Some of the pesticides commonly used on organic crops are applied at rather high rates (pounds per treated acre).|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']
Some are approved for use until almost immediately before harvest.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
In any case, organic-approved pesticides definitely leave residues on treated crops by the time they reach the consumer.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['n']

The below FAQs will help you understand organic food and its benefits in a better way What is Organic Food?|['organic-general']|['p']
On an overall basis, organic food is food prepared and processed without using any chemicals.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
That is, organic food production does not involve the use of chemical fertilizers, chemical pesticides, or chemical preservatives.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['0']
Normally people believe that organic food is better for your health than conventional food.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
However, the USDA and the FDA clearly state that conventional food is as healthy as organic food.|['conventional-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Scientific research has also not been able to conclusively prove that organic food is healthier than conventional food because there has been counter research too to prove conventional food is better than organic one.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['n', 'p']
The exceptions are organic milk and organic tomatoes.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Recent studies on organic milk and organic tomatoes have shown that these food products are healthier than non-organic milk and non-organic tomatoes, respectively.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'conventional-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'n']
Organic food can be identified with the help of an organic logo on the packet.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']
It is illegal to sell non-organic food with an organic label.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['0']

Andrew, can you delineate why organic is less sustainable?|['organic-general', 'organic-trustworthy sources']|['n', 'n']
The main issue is that organic farming produces less food per unit of land than 'conventional' agriculture - sometimes by as much as 50%, but it depends.|['organic-trustworthy sources']|['n']
So with a still-expanding global population and a finite (and, in some areas, disappearing) amount of available arable land, large-scale organic farming is not efficient enough to meet demand.|['organic-environment']|['n']
It's also less consistently reliable as it eschews modern techniques for resisting age-old threats (such as blight) and newer ones (like increasingly unpredictable weather).|['organic-general']|['n']
Finally, it's less 'green' with higher water usage and more CO2 released.|['organic-environment']|['n']

Now that we’ve cleared that up: organic agriculture produces crops, meat, and animal products (like eggs and dairy) without pesticides, herbicides, synthetic fertilizers, hormone supplements, genetic modifications, or antibiotics.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
Instead, organic farmers use more natural methods, like fertilizing fields with compost and allowing their chickens to hunt for insects among the crops.|['organic-general']|['p']
Whether it produces better or healthier food is debatable, but it’s certainly easier on the surrounding ecosystems.|['organic-environment']|['p']

Are GMO's as good as organic?|['GMO-general']|['0']
The former is created strictly for yield, pest and disease resistance, the latter is gown to be as healthy as possible, (to increase yield, pest and disease resistance) You need rich, good dirt to grow organic, and the plants reflect that in nutritional quality.|['GMO-safety and healthiness', 'organic-safety and healthiness', 'organic-experienced quality']|['p', 'p', 'p']

Anyway, about 90% of the corn and soy acreage in the U.S. is GMO with the Roundup Ready trait, which means that it's transgenic and has glyphosate in it.|['GMO-general']|['0']
Glyphosate is also sprayed on a lot of non-GMO crop plantings, either before or after the growing of the crops, so there is a lot in things like millet, for instance, and it's also present in meat and especially edible organs -- so if you're going to cook liver, for instance, you absolutely, definitely want to get an organically raised animal's organs.|['organic-general']|['p']
Anyway, the best advice is to buy organically certified foods if you can, especially when it comes to anything that's soy or corn based.|['organic-general']|['p']

Now, other people in India and throughout the world are learning from Sikkim’s success, and beginning to ask, “Could organic food succeed in other areas, too?” How Sikkim became a fully organic place In 2003, due to chemically intensive, conventional farming methods, the Himalayan state’s food production faced serious environmental and health problems.|['organic-environment', 'organic-safety and healthiness']|['p', 'p']
As a solution, the Chief Minister of Sikkim, Pawan Chamling, announced his vision for Sikkim to be India’s first organic state.|['organic-general']|['p']

Why organic food is important Organic agriculture is important for our health and the future of our world for many reasons.|['organic-safety and healthiness']|['p']
It carries far fewer toxic pesticide residues, and is grown using no GMOs.|['organic-safety and healthiness', 'GMO-general']|['p', 'n']
Organic farming is also better suited to climate change, protects biodiversity, enhances soil fertility, and, to top it off, organic foods are more nutritious and taste better.|['organic-environment', 'organic-experienced quality', 'organic-experienced quality']|['p', 'p', 'p']
But without pesticides and other tools known for producing high-yield agriculture, would organic food really be able to produce enough food to feed people?|['organic-environment']|['n']
Many studies from around the world show that organic farms can produce about as much if not more food than conventional farms.|['organic-environment']|['p']
And in places where most of the world’s hungry live, yield gaps for organic food disappear.|['organic-environment']|['p']
But could the best way to preserve our water supplies, be with organic farming?|['organic-general']|['0']
